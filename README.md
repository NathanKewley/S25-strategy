# S25 Strategy

My take on general strategies and tips for Settlers 2 (RTTR). Mainly things I don't feel are super obvious and are never explained by the game.

## General

### Starting Tips

When the game first starts with  `goods at start == normal` some things to keep in mind:

* 1
* 2
* 3

### Building Layout (GRID)

Somehow I never realized this, but S2 is played on a grid. Seems so obvious now but oh well. If you use the grid properly you can have much much better connected roads and get more buildings placed down. Using the grid system almost guarantees you wont get road blocks (something I used to get a lot off).

* Gird allows small and medium buildings to be placed in between the roads.
* Large buildings will take up more space than the grid allows and need to be built around a bit
* Grid should always be used where possible

## Economy

### Resource Usage Prioritization

### Resource Allocations

### Food Production

### Building placements

### Donkey Breeder

## Military

### Defender Strengths

### Number of Attackers

### Soldier Allocations

### Soldier Strength

* Soldier strength is determined entirely by their HP. 
* Each promotion adds 1 HP. 
* A General is 3x stronger than a Private.

## Appendix

### Buildings

Appendix of buildings and some misc tips. Mostly here because I always have to look up what tools diff building require.

| Building   | Size  | Worker Required | Tool Required | Resources Required | Resources Produced | Ratios                         | Other Tips |
| ---------- | ----- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Woodcutter | Small | Woodcutter      | Axe           | Nearby Trees       | Logs               | 2x for each Sawmill + Forester | N/A        |
